# Problem details
Domain:  Consumer Goods 

Function: Executive Management

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. 
In the "Consumer Goods Domain" Project I worked on the database of the AtliQ hardware project. Facing the challenge of finding a data-informed decision.
I answered 10 ad-hoc requests to extract actionable insights.

Find unique products in different categories like Accessories and notebooks and find which channel brings the most sales Retailer or Distributors.
In SQL I used some advanced concepts like CTE, Windows functions.

This projectenhanced my data analysis, problem-solving and communication skills, contributing to my growth as a data analyst.
